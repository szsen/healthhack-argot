IBM Watson: sucked at reading EMR for cancer
OCR issue for pdfs

need to know how clinical notes are structured
-discharge summary: needs to know themes/purpose of every section
has medication list, don't want to look for symptoms
clinical document architecture

terminology differences from different doctors
-need nlp engine that says terms are synonymous
-concept map showing relations of words

correct sentence in correct context is powerful, but wrong sentence in wrong context means lots of backtracking/corrections/subsitution

continuity of care document in oncology, similar to discharge
